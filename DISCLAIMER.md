## Purpose and Intended Use

REINA (RRT Evidence-Based Integrated Nursing & Attending Support) is designed as an **educational tool and clinical decision support aid** for healthcare professionals managing patients who may require Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) in intensive care settings.

---

## Important Limitations

### Not a Medical Device

REINA is **NOT** a certified medical device. It has not undergone regulatory approval by any health authority (including but not limited to FDA, HSA, CE marking bodies, or TGA).

### Not a Replacement for Clinical Judgment

REINA is intended to **supplement**, not replace:

- Professional medical judgment
- Direct patient assessment
- Institutional protocols and guidelines
- Consultation with specialists (nephrologists, intensivists)
- Manufacturer instructions for RRT equipment

### Evidence Synthesis Limitations

The recommendations provided by REINA are based on evidence synthesis from published clinical trials and guidelines. However:

- Medical evidence continues to evolve
- Trial populations may not represent all patient subgroups
- Local practices and resources may differ from study settings
- Individual patient factors may warrant deviation from general recommendations

---

## Clinical Responsibility

### Healthcare Provider Responsibility

Users of REINA acknowledge that:

1. **Final clinical decisions** rest solely with the treating healthcare provider
2. All recommendations should be **critically evaluated** before implementation
3. Patient-specific factors must be considered that may not be captured by the tool
4. **Institutional protocols** should take precedence when they conflict with REINA suggestions

### Verification Required

Healthcare providers should:

- Verify all calculations independently when clinically significant
- Cross-reference recommendations with current institutional guidelines
- Consult appropriate specialists for complex cases
- Document clinical reasoning independent of tool output

---

## Patient Safety

### Emergency Situations

REINA is **NOT** designed for use as the sole decision-making tool in emergency situations. Always follow established emergency protocols and guidelines.

### Contraindications and Warnings

While REINA attempts to flag contraindications, it may not capture:

- All patient-specific contraindications
- Drug interactions
- Equipment-specific limitations
- Local formulary restrictions

### Monitoring Requirements

Tool recommendations for monitoring are general guidelines. Actual monitoring frequency and parameters should be determined by:

- Patient clinical status
- Institutional capabilities
- Treating team judgment

---

## Technical Limitations

### Input Data Accuracy

REINA's recommendations are only as accurate as the input data provided. Users are responsible for:

- Verifying accuracy of entered values
- Updating data as patient status changes
- Recognizing that laboratory values may not reflect real-time patient status

### Software Limitations

- The tool operates client-side and does not integrate with electronic health records
- Calculations are based on algorithms that may have edge cases not fully addressed
- The interface is optimized for modern browsers; older browsers may have limited functionality
